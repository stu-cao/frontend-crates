# conformance

Parser conformance fixtures, fixture-based Rust tests, and HTML renderers for frontend-crates.

## Ownership

Parser v1/v2 terminology, migration steps, and fixture ownership are documented in [`../docs/PARSERS-V2-MIGRATION-PLAN.md`](../docs/PARSERS-V2-MIGRATION-PLAN.md). New streaming parser authors should also read [`../parsers/v2/README.md`](../parsers/v2/README.md); it explains the vLLM-shaped Rust parser contract, the v2 fixture schema, and the exact `conformance/toolcalling/*` files to add. This README covers conformance layout, render outputs, and test commands.

## Parser paths and modes (universal convention)

- **Dynamo v1** = the batch parser, used two ways: **batch** (the complete text parsed in one call) and **jail+batch** (streaming input is buffered — "jailed" — until a call completes, then batch-parsed and emitted all at once). The jail never streams a call's name/arguments incrementally; only text outside the jail passes through as it arrives.
- **Dynamo v2** = the **streaming** parser (primary mode): emits text and tool-call deltas per chunk, as input arrives. It can also take batch input (the whole text fed as one chunk) — the `batch-on-stream` rows.
- **Per-chunk cells show WHEN output reaches the consumer.** Streaming parsers emit whenever something is parseable, so their cells carry deltas at real chunk positions. The v1 jail bursts at end-of-call — its captures record emission order, not per-chunk timing — so its per-chunk cells stay `—` with a "(bursts at end of call; per-chunk timing not recorded)" header note, and its output appears only in the `assembled` row.
- In the rendered tables, the TC (stream) tab's **default Reference is Dynamo v1 (jail+batch)** — the one stream path with coverage on every family — so every row shows data by default. Star **Dynamo v2** as the Reference to see v2's streaming coverage; families v2 doesn't implement yet gray out as "not implemented".

## Layout

```
conformance/
├── fixtures-manifest.json                         # pins the active fixture snapshot (sha256 per shard)
├── fixtures/                                      # LFS-tracked shard tarballs (the fixture store)
├── tests/*.rs                                     # Rust fixture tests (fixtures extracted from the store on first run)
└── utils/                                         # render, check, and record helpers
```

Fixture YAMLs are not loose in the repo. They live in `conformance/fixtures/` as git-lfs tarball shards (run `git lfs pull` on a fresh clone) and are extracted into `~/.cache/dynamo/conformance-fixtures/` automatically on first use. Snapshot layout:

```
toolcalling/fixtures-batch-v1/<family>/           # v1 tool-calling batch cases
toolcalling/fixtures-stream-v2/<family>/          # v2 stream cases
toolcalling/fixtures-batch-on-stream-v2/<family>/ # v2 complete-text-through-stream cases
reasoning/fixtures-v1/inputs/<family>/            # v1 reasoning cases
```

**Unified capture history is append-only.** Every captured version has its own YAML node under the family directory; unchanged versions are empty deltas that inherit the prior output, so tested versions remain visible without duplicating records. Historical nodes are not silently pruned or rebased; corrections and added cases for an existing release use a new `.patchN` overlay captured from that release's source. Readers fold overlays within one implementation and version. `dynamo_v1` and `dynamo_v2` have separate version histories and never fold together. The manifest-pinned snapshot, not whichever loose directories happen to exist locally, determines what the chart shows.

## End-to-end test cases (a separate surface, kept elsewhere)

Everything under `conformance/` is HERMETIC: a fixed byte string goes into a parser and an exact event list comes out, with no model and no worker. There is a second, complementary surface — the **end-to-end test cases** — which sends real requests to a real Dynamo worker and checks the returned response. It has its own suite/category taxonomy (`reasoning` and `tool_calling` suites; `core` / `complex` / `history` / `tool_boundary` / `arguments_schema` / `parallel_lifecycle` categories), each case run in `stream` and `non-stream` mode, under two thinking-budget variants, at worker `--stream-interval` 20 and 1.

**That suite and its artifacts do not live in this repo.** Its cases arrive as a self-contained HTML report (e.g. `qwen36_pr163_test_cases.html`) whose `const REPORT` embeds every request, expectation and response; the per-case artifacts it names are files of the form `end-to-end case-<num>-<case>-<variant>.json` on whichever machine ran the harness.

The two surfaces answer different questions and neither replaces the other, so where a hermetic case has an e2e counterpart it carries an `End-to-end:` tag naming it. **Those tags and the full artifact index are maintained in ONE place — `utils/lib/parsers/UNIFIED_CASES.md` ("End-to-end test cases" and "Artifact index").** Do not copy the mapping into another doc; a second copy drifts, and `utils/tests/test_unified_taxonomy_covers_corpus.py` only pins the two that already exist.

Per-case tagging currently covers the UNIFIED surface only. The reasoning and tool-calling case docs below have no e2e tags yet — that mapping has not been worked out, and an untagged case means "not yet mapped", not "no e2e coverage".

## Render Outputs

| Output | Command | Parser version | Fixture version |
|---|---|---|---|
| v2 conformance HTML | `conformance/utils/render_table_v2.sh` | Mixed bridge table: `TC batch (v1)` and reasoning tabs use the v1 parser; `TC batch-on-stream (v2)` and `TC stream (v2)` use Dynamo parser v2 code. | `TC batch (v1)` uses v1 batch fixtures; `TC batch-on-stream (v2)` uses v1 batch fixtures plus v2 batch-on-stream overlays; `TC stream (v2)` uses v2 stream fixtures; reasoning tabs use v1 reasoning fixtures. The default example output is `conformance/CONFORMANCE_v2.html`, and the render script also accepts a custom output path. |

## Running the tests

Use the repo's pinned toolchain (Rust 1.96.1 via rustup; a system `cargo` may be too old for the workspace):

```bash
# tool-calling batch parity, all families:
cargo test --locked -p dynamo-conformance-fixtures-v2 --test conformance_toolcalling

# same, but print fixture names and the per-run case count:
cargo test --locked -p dynamo-conformance-fixtures-v2 --test conformance_toolcalling -- --nocapture

# as part of the whole workspace (what CI runs):
cargo test --workspace
```

The test package is named `dynamo-conformance-fixtures-v2` for historical compatibility, but the code ownership still follows the v1/v2 split.

**Lifecycle:** v1 (`dynamo-parsers`, batch + jail) is **interim** — once v2 reaches parity, v1 is removed outright (not merged). v2 (`dynamo-parsers-v2`, streaming-first) is the **ultimate implementation, currently WIP**. New parser work goes to v2. The v1 fixture trees and parity tests exist to hold the line until then; expect them to be deleted together with v1.

| Test | Code under test | Fixtures | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `conformance_toolcalling` | v1 batch parser in `parsers/src/tool_calling/` | v1 batch fixtures (`toolcalling/fixtures-batch-v1/`) | Each `batch` case's `model_text` is fed through `detect_and_parse_tool_call_with_recovery(text, Some(family), tools)` and compared to `expected.dynamo_v1`. |
| `conformance_toolcalling_batch_via_stream` | Dynamo parser v2 in `parsers_v2/src/tool_calling/*` | v1 batch fixtures (`toolcalling/fixtures-batch-v1/`) plus v2 overlays (`toolcalling/fixtures-batch-on-stream-v2/`) | Feeds complete batch text into the v2 stream parser and compares assembled calls to the batch-on-stream expectations. |
| `conformance_toolcalling_stream` | Dynamo parser v2 in `parsers_v2/src/tool_calling/*` | v2 stream fixtures (`toolcalling/fixtures-stream-v2/`) | Checks token-id or text streaming paths per chunk, then checks assembled calls. |

The fixture `family` field is the parser name, the same value Dynamo's `parse_tool_calls_batch` binding takes for v1. Every fixture uses an explicit implementation key: `expected.dynamo_v1`, `expected.dynamo_v2`, `expected.vllm_rust`, `expected.vllm_python`, `expected.sglang_python`. Dynamo v1 and v2 are separate impls with separate version lineages (`dynamo_v1-3.0.0/`, `dynamo_v2-0.1.11/`) — exactly like the vLLM/SGLang runtime variants. Legacy spellings (`dynamo`, `dynamo_rust`, `vllm`, `sglang`) are still accepted on read via the alias table in `utils/src/impls.py`.

Reasoning fixtures are rendered in the v2 HTML table; a Rust fixture harness for reasoning is still a follow-up.

## Refreshing Legacy Fixtures (v1)

Parser fixture sync from Dynamo is retired. Update v1 fixtures through normal frontend-crates PRs and run the renderer documented in [`../docs/PARSERS-V2-MIGRATION-PLAN.md`](../docs/PARSERS-V2-MIGRATION-PLAN.md#ownership).

## Adding Streaming Parser V2 Fixtures

Use [`../parsers_v2/README.md`](../parsers_v2/README.md#fixture-files-to-add) for the parser-side checklist. In conformance, a new streaming family normally needs YAML files under `toolcalling/fixtures-stream-v2/<family>/` and `toolcalling/fixtures-batch-on-stream-v2/<family>/`; add `toolcalling/fixtures-batch-v1/<family>/` entries only when the v1 batch corpus does not already contain that family or taxonomy case. Capture locally with `capture.sh`, then run `package_fixtures.py` and commit the three published paths: `conformance/fixtures/`, `conformance/fixtures-unified-v2/`, and `conformance/fixtures-manifest.json`. Do not commit loose fixture YAMLs to the repo.

The v2 stream fixture schema is documented in [`toolcalling/fixtures-stream-v2/README.md`](toolcalling/fixtures-stream-v2/README.md). Capture and render commands are documented in [`utils/README.md`](utils/README.md).

## Fixture Workflows

The four routine loops. All of them end the same way: `package_fixtures.py` publishes one generation across `conformance/fixtures/`, `conformance/fixtures-unified-v2/`, and `conformance/fixtures-manifest.json`; commit all three paths together (see [`utils/README.md`](utils/README.md#fixture-store-git-lfs)).

**Title fixture/table-only PRs `chore(conformance):`, never `feat:`.** The repo is squash-merge only and GitHub is set to `squash_merge_commit_title: PR_TITLE` with a BLANK body, so the PR TITLE becomes the entire commit message on `main` — it is the only Conventional Commit that release-plz ever reads. The branch's own commit types are discarded, so retitling the PR is both necessary and sufficient. `feat:` proposes a MINOR version bump on every crate whose packaged contents changed ([`../RELEASING.md`](../RELEASING.md#bump-policy) has the full bump table); re-capturing fixtures or re-rendering the table is not a library feature and must not move a published version. Use `feat:` only when parser CODE under `parsers/` changed behaviour. Fixture-only work is outside every crate's packaged contents, so it proposes no bump.

### 1. Capture a new vLLM/SGLang engine version (new peer shards)

**The rule is ALL corpora, ALL families.** A new vLLM/SGLang version must land on EVERY tab — `TC batch (v1)`, `TC stream (v2)`, `TC batch-on-stream (v2)`, AND `Reasoning` — so the table stays consistent across tabs. Refreshing one tab and leaving the others behind is a bug, not a shortcut: every tab is multi-version and renders each captured version as its own comparison candidate.

0. **Rebase onto `main` FIRST.** The conformance renderer + capture tooling change often (the whole page was rewritten in DIS-2434; the marker layer in #127). Capturing on a stale base means redoing the render/verify against a since-rewritten generator. Rebase, then capture.
1. **Pin the version** in `utils/src/pyproject.stub.toml` (peer versions are read from there, never hardcoded). This repository owns the peer versions independently of Dynamo's runtime pins.
2. **Bring up the engine containers at the new versions and extract the corpus** so the capture seeds are on disk. Parser capture needs NO GPU — it feeds stored model-text through the parser, not the model:
   ```bash
   docker run -d --name vllm-localdev   --entrypoint sleep <vllm-image>   infinity
   docker run -d --name sglang-localdev --entrypoint sleep <sglang-image> infinity
   python3 conformance/utils/src/extract_fixtures.py   # materialize inputs the capturers read
   ```
3. **Capture EVERY corpus** — one command per corpus × peer. Each writes a NEW `<impl>-<newver>/` version dir (append-only; see the rule above). Capturers read the version LIVE from the container's `vllm.__version__` / `sglang.__version__`, write only cases that DIVERGE from the lowest-version anchor, never touch existing dirs, and skip (never fabricate) cases a parser can't run in-container.

   All peer captures run through one shared tool, `capture_peer_versions.py --corpus {batch,stream,reasoning} --impl {vllm_python,sglang_python,vllm_rust}` (omit `--impl` for all engines valid on that corpus; `vllm_rust` is stream-only):

   | Tab | vLLM Python | vLLM Rust | SGLang |
   |---|---|---|---|
   | `TC stream (v2)` | `capture_peer_versions.py --corpus stream --impl vllm_python` | `capture_peer_versions.py --corpus stream --impl vllm_rust` ‡ | `capture_peer_versions.py --corpus stream --impl sglang_python` |
   | `TC batch (v1)` | `capture_peer_versions.py --corpus batch --impl vllm_python` | — (no Rust batch parser) | `capture_peer_versions.py --corpus batch --impl sglang_python` |
   | `TC batch-on-stream (v2)` | `recapture_batch_on_stream.py` (in-place, single-snapshot) | `recapture_batch_on_stream.py` | `recapture_batch_on_stream.py` |
   | `Reasoning` | `capture_peer_versions.py --corpus reasoning --impl vllm_python` | — | `capture_peer_versions.py --corpus reasoning --impl sglang_python` |

   ‡ vLLM Rust is source-only: set `VLLM_RUST_SOURCE=<vllm checkout at the tag>` (or pass `--vllm-rust-source`) first. In vLLM ≥ 0.25 the crate is `vllm-parser` at `rust/src/parser` (was `vllm-tool-parser` at `rust/src/tool-parser`), and `ToolParserOutput` is an ordered events list. A parser that moved to the native `unified::` interface between releases is marked unavailable via the `tool::` probe — expected, not a failure.
4. **Package:** `package_fixtures.py` → new `<impl>-<newver>.tar.gz` shards appear; existing shards rebuild byte-identical (deterministic tars, mtime=0). Commit all three published paths named above together.
5. **Verify the new version shows on ALL tabs.** The generator discovers each `<impl>-<newver>/` dir as its own candidate. Run `render_table_v2.sh` and confirm the new version is a Reference/Compare candidate on all four tabs (grep the rendered HTML), then `python3 -m pytest conformance/utils/tests/` and `check.sh dynamo all`. `test_model.py::test_v2_reasoning_uses_current_peers` specifically guards that the Reasoning tab surfaces every peer version dir — if it fails after you add a version, the tab lost multi-version rendering.

### 2. Fix a Dynamo parser and refresh its expected outputs

1. Fix the code under `parsers/v1/` or `parsers/v2/`.
2. `cargo test --workspace` — if the fix changes output, the parity tests FAIL. That is the regression gate working: decide whether the diff is a bug in your fix or an intended behavior change.
3. For an intended v2 change, capture under a source-qualified unpublished identity (workflow 3), then run `package_fixtures.py`. A release capture must be produced from its tagged source, not a branch with the same crate version.
4. Commit the parser fix and all three published fixture paths together. CI is green only when the code and the pinned expectations agree again; release publication is a separate workflow.

### Unified parser hard gate

Unified work is complete only when the selected current Dynamo column has **zero empty cells and zero red cells** for the affected family. This is a hard gate. `reason:`, `unavailable:`, a historical column, stale HTML, or changing GOLDEN to match broken output does not satisfy it.

For a model-family conversion, collection is mandatory work, not a follow-up. Generate the family's Unified authored inputs and golden events, run the live Unified parser capture with its verified source identity, explode it, update the YAML history and manifest pin, extract the pinned snapshot, and render the canonical v2 report. The current capture node must exist in each affected family history before the row can be considered collected. Never generate `CONFORMANCE_unified.html`; `CONFORMANCE_v2.html` is the only HTML report for this workflow.

Use this loop:

1. **Write:** make the parser or capture change.
2. **Read:** render `conformance/CONFORMANCE_v2.html`, open the Unified tab, and inspect every empty or red cell's popup. Compare its exact input, request initialization, chunks, GOLDEN events, and current Dynamo events.
3. **Fix:** repair the owner of the discrepancy. An empty current cell is missing capture data. A red current cell is a parser mismatch unless the authored GOLDEN is demonstrably wrong.
4. **Regenerate:** rebuild the qualified current capture, package its shard and manifest, and render the HTML again from the same worktree.
5. **Re-read:** inspect the rendered Unified column again. Repeat until both counts are zero.

`render_table_v2.sh` always writes `conformance/CONFORMANCE_v2.json` beside the HTML and prints the total empty/red count. The standard scoped gate is `conformance/utils/check.sh status --model qwen3 --tab unified`; it renders first, prints every empty or red case, and exits nonzero until the row is clear. Use the lower-level `validate_conformance_status.py` only to inspect an already-rendered file. Then run `cargo test --locked -p dynamo-conformance-fixtures-v2 --test unified_render -- --nocapture` and `cargo test --locked -p dynamo-conformance-fixtures-v2 --test unified_parity -- --nocapture`. Do not report Unified work complete while either rendered count is nonzero.

The complete current-family collection sequence is:

```bash
python3 conformance/utils/src/gen_unified_golden.py
cargo test --locked -p dynamo-conformance-fixtures-v2 --test unified_render -- --nocapture
python3 conformance/utils/src/explode_unified_fixtures.py
python3 conformance/utils/src/package_fixtures.py
python3 conformance/utils/src/extract_fixtures.py --full-refresh
conformance/utils/render_table_v2.sh --output conformance/CONFORMANCE_v2.html
conformance/utils/check.sh status --model <family> --tab unified
cargo test --locked -p dynamo-conformance-fixtures-v2 --test unified_parity -- --nocapture
python3 -m pytest conformance/utils/tests/test_model.py
```

Use `bash conformance/utils/regenerate_unified.sh` to run this sequence as one gate. It compiles and captures the live Unified parser, updates and re-extracts the YAML history, renders the JSON/HTML report, runs the consuming tests, and fails when the generator, current history, or rendered Unified cells disagree. The script renders JSON and HTML even when a later validation stage fails, so humans can inspect the current red or empty cells; a failed exit code means the report is diagnostic, not ready to publish.

Do not substitute a loose harness feed for the package step. The v2 table reads the extracted packaged snapshot, so an un-packaged family cannot appear in its Unified tab.

### 3. Version rule: fixture labels identify the source actually captured

For v2 captures, `dynamo_version.py` verifies the parser sources and build inputs against the release tag before accepting a plain version. Unpublished source uses `<crate-version>+source.<sha256>` instead. The digest covers source content independently of generated fixtures, so packaging does not change the producer identity. Capture producers and current-column selectors share this helper; an explicit release label or source digest that does not match the checkout fails. Keep published shards unchanged and add new source-qualified shards or historical backfill overlays. Crate publication and version bumps follow [`../RELEASING.md`](../RELEASING.md#manual-version-peg-fixture-synced-releases); changing `Cargo.toml` alone does not establish released provenance.

### 4. What CI actually checks (the regression gate)

The `rust` CI job checks out the LFS store (`lfs: true`), extracts the manifest-pinned snapshot, and runs the parity tests — current parser code vs pinned expected YAML:

- `conformance_toolcalling`: v1 code vs `expected.dynamo_v1` in the `dynamo_v1-<ver>/` dir of `fixtures-batch-v1`.
- `conformance_toolcalling_stream`: v2 code vs `expected.dynamo_v2` folded from the LOWEST `dynamo_v2-<ver>/` dir — the v2 anchor. (The v1-jail reference lives in its own `dynamo_v1-3.0.0/` namespace and never enters the v2 fold. Overlay folding up to the pinned crate version is a follow-up; until then an intended v2 output change must be reflected in the anchor's expected blocks at re-capture.)
- `conformance_toolcalling_batch_via_stream`: v2 code vs the `fixtures-batch-on-stream-v2` expectations.

A parser change that alters output fails CI until the fixtures are re-captured and committed (workflow 2) — CI compares Dynamo against the pinned shard YAMLs, nothing else. The `conformance-table` CI job runs exactly one command, `conformance/utils/check.sh ci`, which re-renders both HTML pages from the same pinned store, runs the coverage/marker lint (section 8), and the chart-invariant guards. To add or change a conformance gate, edit `run_ci()` in `check.sh`; the workflow file stays untouched.

### 5. Add a new test case (e.g. a new `TOOLCALLING.streamv2.5.h`)

A "case" is one numeric-suffix sub-case shared across families. New case IDs use `<num>-<num>` or `<letters/num>-<num>`; do not allocate new letter suffixes because a long-running taxonomy can exhaust `a` through `z`. Adding one is FOUR edits, in order:

1. **Input.** Add the case to `toolcalling/fixtures-stream-v2/inputs/<family>/TOOLCALLING.streamv2.<N>.yaml` for each family it applies to — the shared per-chunk `delta_text` (schema in [`toolcalling/fixtures-stream-v2/README.md`](toolcalling/fixtures-stream-v2/README.md#fixture-schema)). Batch cases go under `toolcalling/fixtures-batch-v1/inputs/<family>/` instead.
2. **Description.** Add a bullet to `utils/lib/parsers/TOOLCALLING_STREAMING_V2_CASES.md` (or the batch/reasoning CASES.md) — the HTML "Case descriptions" section renders it, and the tooltip links to it.
3. **Grouping (easy to miss).** Add the case id to its band in **`utils/src/fixtures.py`** `BATCH_SUB_CASE_GROUPS` (the streamv2 tab reuses the batch taxonomy). If you skip this, the column still renders but sorts to the FAR RIGHT as an "unknown" case instead of beside its `<num>.*` siblings. That list now lives in exactly one place, so a case is one edit. A new `<num>.<letter>` should ideally key on its parent `<num>`, not enumerate every letter.
4. **Capture + package.** `refresh_dynamo_captures.py stream` (records the Dynamo v2 output for the new case), then `package_fixtures.py`, then commit all three published fixture paths. Peer engines (vLLM/SGLang) only cover the new case once re-captured against containers (workflow 1); until then the peer cells read `(no expectation)`.

### 6. Backfill an OLD parser version onto a new case (`.patchN` overlays)

To show what an already-released parser version would have produced on a case that didn't exist at its release (e.g. render Dynamo v2 `0.1.11`'s behavior on the new `5.h`), WITHOUT rewriting the pristine `0.1.11` shard:

1. Build the old binary: `git worktree add <path> <release-commit>` (find it via `git log -S'version = "0.1.11"' -- '**/Cargo.toml'`), then `cargo build -p dynamo-parsers-v2 --bin record_dynamo_stream` there.
2. Run that binary on the new-case input, and write the result into a NEW dir named `dynamo_v2-<ver>.patchN/` (`captured_with: <ver>.patchN`) — a full copy of the base `<ver>` capture plus the backfilled case. The pristine `dynamo_v2-<ver>/` shard stays byte-identical.
3. `package_fixtures.py` → the new history node and manifest pin. Commit all three published fixture paths.

How `.patchN` is treated: **HTML** folds it into its base `<ver>` display column (it's the same binary, just re-run — `_base_stream_version` / `_impl_version_families` in `generate_conformance_table.py`), so it is NOT a separate candidate. **Parity tests** EXCLUDE `.patchN` dirs entirely (`version_dirs_ascending` in `tests/common/mod.rs`) — they validate the CURRENT parser, and a `.patchN` is an old binary that must never shadow the latest capture.

### 7. Classify a v1-batch vs v2-stream difference (`known-divergences.yaml`)

`conformance_toolcalling_batch_via_stream` compares the v2 stream parser on batch text against v1's `expected.dynamo_v1`. v1 and v2 differ **by design** (v2 preserves surrounding/inter-call prose that v1 batch trims; v2 recovers bare calls v1 drops). When a case legitimately diverges, add it to `toolcalling/known-divergences.yaml` under `<family> → TOOLCALLING.batch.<case> → stream_vs_batch: <note>` (reuse the `*svb-surrounding-text` / `*svb-recovery` anchors). An entry with a note is an allowed, documented difference; a MISSING entry fails the test — so the file is also the audit trail of "v2 improved on v1 here." Do NOT add an entry to paper over an actual regression (v2 dropping text, leaking markup, corrupting args) — fix the parser instead.

### 8. Coverage taxonomy: what "complete fixtures for a family" means (DIS-2442)

`conformance/case-taxonomy.yaml` is the machine-readable definition of complete coverage — every batch/stream/reasoning case group and sub-case, with per-case requiredness and applicability rules. It replaces the old implicit standard (the union of `description:` fields across ~20 families that reviewers had to reverse-engineer per PR).

For Unified corpus changes, regeneration is part of the edit, not a final cleanup step. After every change to a generator, taxonomy, golden specification, fixture manifest, capture label, or coverage documentation, immediately run the generator, explode the loose captures, update `conformance/fixtures-unified-v2/`, refresh the manifest pin, render `CONFORMANCE_v2.json` and `CONFORMANCE_v2.html`, and run the consuming Rust/Python tests. Repeat that complete chain after the final edit. Before reporting or pushing, assert that the seven `inputs_and_golden.yaml` family documents and each Dynamo capture chain after resolving its explicit parents cover exactly the generator's case-ID set. Source tests against stale YAML or stale HTML do not validate the change.

```bash
# The authoring loop for a new family: the FAIL list is the fixture TODO list.
conformance/utils/check.sh coverage --family <family>

# Whole-corpus gate (what CI runs in the conformance-table job):
conformance/utils/check.sh coverage
```

Rules the lint enforces: a required case must exist as real input (`model_text`/`chunks`) or as a placeholder carrying an `explanation:` (silence fails; "not yet authored" placeholders warn — they are the acknowledged backfill list). A family registered in `parser_families.yaml` with no fixtures dir for a suite fails (the "ALL stream cases missing" class). Case IDs unknown to the taxonomy fail, so a PR that invents a new group/sub-case must extend `case-taxonomy.yaml` in the same PR. Pre-taxonomy gaps are grandfathered under `known_gaps:` — remove the ID when the fixture lands.

The same command runs the marker-registration lint: each family declares its grammar tokens once in the `markers:` section of `parser_families.yaml` (`pairs` / `singletons` / `leak`), from which the `↯` leak regex (`markers.py`) and the popup token coloring (`utils/src/tables/markup.py`) are derived.

### Invariants the tooling now enforces (so you don't have to remember)

- **Renders/tests read the manifest-pinned snapshot dir directly**, not the shared `<cache>/toolcalling` symlink — sibling `frontend-crates*` checkouts pinning other snapshots used to race to repoint it, so a render could read a snapshot missing the newest version. Enforced in `utils/src/_common.sh`.
- **`package_fixtures.py` recomputes the sha256 of every kept shard from disk**, never copying the prior manifest's value — a restored/re-pinned store file can no longer produce a manifest that lies about its content (which broke `extract_fixtures`' sha-verify).
- **Fixture coverage is diffed against `case-taxonomy.yaml` in CI** (`check_family_coverage.py`, section 8) — a new family missing required case groups, a whole stream corpus, or an unexplained placeholder fails the conformance-table job before human review (the PR #120 gap classes).
- **Family grammar tokens are declared once in `parser_families.yaml` `markers:`** — the leak detector and popup colorizer derive from it, and a family without a declaration fails the coverage lint (undeclared tokens used to render leaks as clean cells and every token as a red orphan).
