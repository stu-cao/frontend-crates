//! Until a consumer arms the pool (`execution::init_pool`), this crate must
//! not own worker threads — with or without rayon linked: a serving engine
//! supplies concurrency across requests and pins its own cores, so a library
//! spawning pools behind its back would fight it.
//!
//! Guarded from the outside (thread count of the process) rather than by
//! inspecting the code, so it stays true no matter how the fan-out seam in
//! `execution` is refactored. Lives in its own test binary so nothing else
//! arms the pool in this process.
