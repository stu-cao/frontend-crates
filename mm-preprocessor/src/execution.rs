//! The crate's only parallelism seam.
//!
//! All fan-out goes through the functions below. By default they run inline
//! on the calling thread — servers already provide cross-request concurrency
//! and shouldn't have a library spawning pools behind their back. Consumers
//! that call in from few threads (e.g. a Python processor) can call
//! [`init_pool`] once to fan out on a crate-owned rayon pool instead.
//! Hosts that already parallelize preprocessing should leave it unarmed to
//! avoid nested parallelism.
//!
//! "Inline" means *on the caller*, not a one-thread pool: `install` on a
//! 1-sized pool would serialize every concurrent request in the process.
//!
//! Successful results are identical either way — the fan-outs are order-preserving maps
//! and disjoint-slice writes, never reductions.
//!
//! The `parallel` cargo feature (default on) only controls whether rayon is
//! linked; disabling it drops [`init_pool`] and forces the inline path.
